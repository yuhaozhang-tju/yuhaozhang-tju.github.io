<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently an Associate Researcher with the <a href="http://cic.tju.edu.cn">College of Intelligence and Computing</a>, <a href="https://www.tju.edu.cn">Tianjin University</a>, Tianjin, China. And I am a member of TANK Lab, led by <a href="https://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/likeqiu/index.html">Prof.Keqiu Li</a>. From 2022 to 2024, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the <a href="https://storage.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn">Storage Research Group</a> (advised by <a href="https://storage.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jiwu-shu/">Prof.Jiwu Shu</a> and <a href="https://storage.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lu/">Youyou Lu)</a>, Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. I received the PhD degree from the School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, Qingdao, China, in June 2022. My research interest includes storage system and AI system.
